## 👨‍💻 Developer Notes

This project was developed and deployed using GitHub Pages, leveraging custom design techniques and responsive editing for a seamless user experience. While GitHub Pages is ideal for static sites, it does have limitations such as no PHP or dynamic server-side scripting. Future expansion may require CPanel hosting for backend capabilities.
